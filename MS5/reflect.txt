The final solution of the project involved completing the implementation of the AidMan files. Though i only worked on the list items option, I was able to implement all the previous code from the other milestones. The list items displays the list of products and then further allows the user to pick a product based on the row number to display details about the quantity needed and avaliable, price, and needed purchase fund. Throughout the project. The overall OOP244 course has been a big jump from learning C. I was introduced to many topics such as dynamic memory allocation, virtual functions, and derived classes, to name a few. I also encountered many memory leak errors throughout the course as well as while working on this project and have had to learn how to fix these types of errors. Having previous knowledge of the C language was helpful in understanding the basis of C++. Overall, C++ is a very versatile language with a lot to learn.
