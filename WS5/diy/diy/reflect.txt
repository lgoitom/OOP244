In the course of this workshop, we delved into the concept of operator overloading, a fundamental aspect of C++ programming. Operator overloading allows us to define unique behaviors for operators within a given scope. It's a mechanism that allows functions to be redefined to work with different data types and object references, provided that the function signatures and parameters are properly differentiated. These overloaded functions, are defined by their return types and parameter lists.

In our workshop, we primarily explored return types as object references or fundamental data types like integers or doubles. The parameter lists frequently included constants references to objects, doubles, or integers. By defining these overloaded functions, we could specify how each operator should behave within this context, enabling us to create code that performs specific operations tailored to parts of the program. This understanding of operator overloading enhances the flexibility and extensibility of our code.
