During this workshop, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into dynamic memory allocation, a fundamental concept in programming. The primary task involved dynamically allocating data extracted from the given CSV file. In the lab section, the objective was to display all the data. However, the DIY required the data to be selectively presented based on user input. This led me to learn about the `strstr` function which is used to determine if two strings match.

One crucial lesson emphasized throughout was the significance of proper dynamic memory allocation. Ensuring that memory is allocated and deallocated appropriately is essential to prevent memory leaks, which can result in data loss or even program errors. This workshop highlighted the importance of efficient memory management in programming, demonstrating how negligence in this area can have consequences for the program's functionality and stability. Overall, this expanded my understanding of memory management and its vital role in software development.
