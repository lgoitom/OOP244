This workshop provided a small introduction to C++ programming and its structural foundations. Drawing parallels with the C language, it demonstrated the concept of functions as the building blocks of programs, including the essential presence of the main function. C++ code operates within a namespace, which serves as a container for built-in classes and identifiers. This organizational structure helps prevent naming conflicts between different parts of the codebase.

During the workshop, we explored functions from the standard namespace, such as cin and cout. The cout function facilitates program output, while cin handles user input, similar to the functionality of scanf and printf in C. Familiar concepts from C, including header files and pass-by-references, were covered. Additionally, we delved into reading text from external files, showcasing the practicality and versatility of C++ for handling real-world programming tasks. Overall, this workshop laid some groundwork for understanding C++ as an evolution of C with more capabilities.
