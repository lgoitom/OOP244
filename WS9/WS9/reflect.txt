This workshop has been helpful in my comprehension of derived classes, resource administration, and inheritance hierarchies. Notably, I've learned how significant it is to meticulously manage resources in derived classes, alongside the careful handling of base class calls within constructors and specialized member functions. Additionally, I've learned about the crucial role played by destructor calls in inheritance hierarchies. Implementing constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and copy assignment operators within the Student class helped me gained a better understanding into the sensitivity of memory management, focusing on dynamically allocated resources, specifically in this workshop with name and age. Coming across challenges with resource management across derived classes emphasized how important precise memory allocation and deallocation in class hierarchies is. This understanding can help me write more memory efficient code, ensuring optimal resource utilization while trying to avoid as many memory leaks as possible. This workshop increased my knowledge in resource management within derived classes, and becoming more comfortable with inheritance, constructors, and destructors.
